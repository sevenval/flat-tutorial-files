# FLAT Tutorial source files

This repository contains all the source files used in the [FLAT Tutorial](https://sevenval.gitbook.io/flat/tutorial), including most of the intermediate steps.

To run a version of the project, change into the corresponding directory and run `flat start` commands as documented in the tutorial. As an alternative, we have provided a `docker-compose.yml` in each directory, so that you can also use `docker-compose up`. After the FLAT container has started, you should be able to run the `curl` commands given in the tutorial, e.g. `curl localhost:8080/html`.
